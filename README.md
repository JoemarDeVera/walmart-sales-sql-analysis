# Introduction
This project analyzes Walmart sales data across three branches — Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyitaw — over a 3-month period. The goal is to uncover key insights into branch performance, customer preferences, and product trends, helping to understand how sales vary by location and category.

# The Tools I Used
- SQL 
- MySQL

#  The Analysis
## 1. Branch and City Mapping
**Question:** Which branches are operating in which cities?

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city, branch
FROM sales
ORDER BY branch;
```

| City      | Branch |
|-----------|--------|
| Yangon    | A      |
| Mandalay  | B      |
| Naypyitaw | C      |

*Table showing the mapping of each branch to its respective city.*

### Insights: 
- The dataset includes three branches, each located in a different city: Yangon (Branch A), Mandalay (Branch B), and Naypyitaw (Branch C).  
- This helps in analyzing sales, customer behavior, and product trends **by branch and city**, making it easier to compare performance across locations.


## 2. Market Reach and Branch Performance
**Question:** Which city and branch generate the most revenue?

```sql
SELECT
    city,
    branch,
    SUM(total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY city, branch
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

| City      | Branch | Revenue       |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Naypyitaw | C      | 110568.7065 |
| Yangon    | A      | 106200.3705 |
| Mandalay  | B      | 106197.6720 |

*Table showing the total revenue generated by each city and branch.*

### Insights
- **Naypyitaw (Branch C)** recorded the highest sales at `110,568.71`.  
- **Yangon (Branch A)** closely follows with sales of `106,200.37`.
